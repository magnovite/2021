              <h2>Description and Rules</h2>
           We know there exists a lot of schools of  psychology, each school has its strengths as well as weaknesses.
            So, to bring together all the schools of psychology together, an event where each school gets a chance to 
            speak for its own foundation and strengths can be organized. A debate sort of environment where you can cross 
            question any school, try to use your original thoughts and logic to provide a backup to any argument, ensuring
            that the argument in itself is formed on the facts. Multiple schools of psychology like behaviourism, psychoanalysis,
            structuralism etc. can be taken in, and further groups can be formed accordingly. The teams can form their own names,
            something incongruence with that particular school.<br><br>
